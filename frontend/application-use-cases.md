app 1)

Use cases

	somebody drags a freesurfer directory or selects t1 images

	at which point in time, 

		group tasks together that were submitted together

		run freesurfer, harvest provenance metadata, push up to server

		give back as json object a bundle which should have directory information, and ability to query prov data


		each app launched a virtual machine to run

			-> with the intent keeping tasks self-contained
